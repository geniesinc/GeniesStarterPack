### Summary

- Genies Starter Pack is a Unity project containing five rigged avatars, each with a humanoid skeleton, 52 facial blendshapes for real-time animation, and a sample integration with [Unity’s ThirdPerson CharacterController Starter Assets](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/third-person-controller-basic-locomotion-free-82048).
- These avatars are representative of what Genies users can create using the upcoming Genies Developer Platform, sans certain proprietary components such as hair dynamics and custom shaders.
- Genies materials can be found in the ../Assets/Project subdirectory. Materials found elsewhere are third party and belong to their respective license holders.
